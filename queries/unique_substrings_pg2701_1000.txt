that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of Gods wrath therefore we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight In Saint Stylites the famous Christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads who was not to b

 has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists So with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud Ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together Meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt Few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swu

falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us But here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the Sperm Whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands Broad on both bows at the distance of some two or thre

reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it All that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and ca

atter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls And though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now Why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow Or to the unread unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an 
n before a Greenland Justice of the Peace In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery there are two other French engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself H Durand One of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific a French whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air The effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose The other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hove-to upon the open sea and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life with a Right Whale alongside the vessel in the act of cutting-in hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity i
udes where the Right Whale is often chased But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers Seen from the mast-heads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else And as in the great hunting countries of India the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea And even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse Indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore For though some old natural

iprocating by rapping his knees in front He is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth Merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up Then again it would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it would never do I say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self-command he generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast Nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsmans hair and h
idely separated unfrequent armies That is all And equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining For they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle Furthermore concerning these last mentioned Leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable And as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle of everlasting December bid defiance to all pursuit from man But a

ogether and our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warming-pans We felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bed-clothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room The more so I say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast Nothing exists in itself If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more But if like Queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness
 aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes With not one tenth of Englands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt For the most part the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid Even Scoresby the justly renowned Right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a

t may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast But even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror As for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish The Romish mass for the dead begins with Requiem eternam eternal rest whence Requiem denominating
